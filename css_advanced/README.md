# 🎓 Get Schooled - Homepage Project

Hello! 👋  
This is my homepage project called **Get Schooled**. It’s meant to be a simple, clean landing page for an education website. I'm still learning HTML and CSS, and this project helped me understand how real websites are built step by step.

## 🧠 What I Wanted to Build

I wanted to build a homepage that:

- Shows the purpose of the website clearly.
- Looks modern and colorful.
- Has sections like testimonials, courses, and FAQs.
- Is easy for users to read and navigate.

## 🧩 Page Sections

### 1. **Header**
- Has the site’s name and a menu.
- I plan to make the menu links clickable in the future.

### 2. **Hero Section**
- A big image with a title that says “Get Schooled”.
- There’s a button that could take users to the main course page.

### 3. **Meet the Pros**
- Shows profile pictures and names of experts/teachers.
- Gives users confidence to learn from the best.

### 4. **Testimonial**
- A quote from a happy user.
- I added this to build trust.

### 5. **Popular Courses**
- Thumbnails of different courses with names and short info.

### 6. **Free Membership**
- A section that explains the benefits of joining.
- There’s another button to get started.

### 7. **FAQ**
- Common questions and answers.
- I plan to add interactivity later using JavaScript.

### 8. **Footer**
- Contains copyright.
- Includes social media icons and other links.

## 🔧 Next Steps

Now that the design is ready, I plan to:

- Try making it responsive so it works on mobile too.
- Maybe add simple JavaScript later for interactivity (like opening and closing FAQ items).

## 🧑‍🎓 Why I Made This

I’m learning to become a front-end developer, and this project helped me practice layout design and understand how a full webpage is planned before writing any code.

Thanks for checking out my work! 😊
